  <mainDescription>This step involves the modification of the actual unit test package for the affected code unit, in accordance with the&#xD;
modifications made to the test plans and objectives. It will be assumed that the test package contains computer software to&#xD;
drive and evaluate the unit under test, along with narrative procedures recorded in accompanying computer files. These test&#xD;
packages are under automated configuration management, and a new version of the unit test package is created when this step&#xD;
ends. Finally, it is noted that the modified design and/or the source code for this unit may be used as input to this step;&#xD;
however, this is not always the case. Subsequent iterations of this step may be based upon feedback from testing,&#xD;
indicating that additional modifications to the unit test package are required.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>1. This step can begin as soon as the modify test plans step has completed. 2. This step ends when its output has been&#xD;
produced. 3. Subsequent iterations (if required) can begin as soon as the test unit step has completed.</keyConsiderations>
