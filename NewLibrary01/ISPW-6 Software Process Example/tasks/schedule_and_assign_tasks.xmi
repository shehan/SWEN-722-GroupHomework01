  <mainDescription>This step is a project management function, and is the first step carried out in this example process. It involves&#xD;
developing a schedule for the work to be undertaken for this software change, and assigning individual tasks to specific&#xD;
staff members: specifically, a design engineer and a quality assurance (QA) engineer. The design review is also scheduled,&#xD;
and participants are assigned to it; the participants will be the design and QA engineer, along with two other software&#xD;
engineers. Assume that the basic process to be followed in this example is already familiar to the participants; it is&#xD;
standard procedure for this organization. Consequently, this management step focuses on assignment of resources to the&#xD;
tasks and estimation of the schedule required for those resources to caw out the tasks.</mainDescription>

    1. This step can begin as soon as authorization to make the change is granted by the CCB. 2. This step ends when its&#xD;
    outputs have been provided; assume that all outputs are produced simultaneously.&#xD;
