  <mainDescription>This step deals with a set of objects (entities) whose attributes and interrelationships need to be recorded. Both source&#xD;
and object code are under automated configuration management. The latest vcrsion of the software unit’s source code&#xD;
provides the starting point for modification during this process 181 Authorized licensed use limited to: Rochester&#xD;

successful compilation, a new version of the unit’s source code is recorded, along with its corresponding object code. In&#xD;
addition, these must be related to the modified design upon which they are based. Source code information includes the&#xD;
body, creation timestamp, version information, and engineer responsible for this change. Object code information includes&#xD;
the body, target system, and creation timestamp. Each source code instance can have multiple corresponding object code&#xD;
instances. Similarly each design version can relate to multiple source code instances. For each successful compilation of a&#xD;
given source code instance, it is important to record the timestamp, the compiler version used, all compiler options&#xD;
selected (e.g., optimizer on, debugging on), any error or warning messages produced, and listings and associated&#xD;
documentation such as memory maps. &lt;br /></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>1. This step can begin as soon as the task has been assigned by the project manager. (Thus, it is possible, if not&#xD;
advisable, to begin coding before the design work has even begun.) The engineer’s discretion determines when this task will&#xD;
actually commence, if the design has not yet been approved. If this step has not commenced earlier, it will begin when the&#xD;
design is approved. 2. Modified code released for testing is to reflect the approved modified design. One consequence is&#xD;
that this step cannot be completed before the modified design has been approved. 3. This step ends when a clean compilation&#xD;
(no errors) has been accomplished and its output has been provided. 4. Subsequent iterations (if required) can begin as&#xD;
soon as the test unit step has completed.</keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>This step involves the implementation of the design changes into code, and compilation of the modified source code into&#xD;
object code. Implementation is accomplished by modifying existing source code. This step may also be based upon feedback&#xD;
from testing, indicating that additional source code modifications are required.</purpose>
