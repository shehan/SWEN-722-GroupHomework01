  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The entire test package is run before any analysis or further action is taken. Although the unit tests are primarily&#xD;
    functional, an automated coverage analyzer is employed to determine that adequate test coverage of the unitâ€™s code has&#xD;
    been achieved; a 90% threshold has been established as acceptable. (see key considerations 2)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to confine the problem, assume that either or both of the following are the outcomes of this analysis: the&#xD;
    source code needs to be modified further, the unit tests need to be modified further. When the indicated modifications&#xD;
    have been made, the unit can be retested. If the unit passes its tests and meets an acceptable coverage level, then&#xD;
    this example process has been completed. Steps beyond unit testing, such as integration testing, are beyond the scope&#xD;
    of the core problem. The project manager is notified that the latest version of the unit code is available for&#xD;
    integration testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>1. This step can begin as soon as both the object code and unit test package are available. 2.&amp;nbsp; If all tests are&#xD;
successfully completed, and 90% coverage attained, then the unit has successfully passed. When this is not the case, the&#xD;
design and QA engineers jointly analyze the test results and determine appropriate actions. 3. This step ends when its&#xD;
outputs have been provided; assume that all outputs are produced simultaneously.</keyConsiderations>
