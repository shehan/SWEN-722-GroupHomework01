  <mainDescription>This step involves the project manager monitoring progress and status of the work. This is based upon notification of&#xD;
completion of each step, as well as informal information. While work proceeds according to plan, no action is taken and no&#xD;
output is developed by this step. On the other hand, deviations from plan can result in rescheduling of tasks. In severe&#xD;
cases, the project manager may put the entire modification effort on hold, and recommend to the CCB that this change effort&#xD;
be canceled. The CCB may either concur and cancel the effort, or indicate that it is to be resumed where it left off. In&#xD;
such cases the affected personnel are notified (by the project manager) as appropriate regarding the resumption or&#xD;
cancellation of their work on this change.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>1. This step can begin as soon as the initial task, schedule and assign tasks, is completed. 2. This step persists&#xD;
throughout the duration of this process. For the purposes of this example, assume that this task ends (1) when the unit&#xD;
testing has been successfully completed, or (2) after notifying personnel of cancellation by the CCB.</keyConsiderations>
